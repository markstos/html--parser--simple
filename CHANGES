Revision history for Perl extension HTML::Parser::Simple.

      - Improved tests and documentation (Mark Stosberg)
      - Added attribute parsing (Mark Stosberg)

1.02  Thu Feb 26 11:24:00 2009
	  - Rename scripts/parse.file.pl to scripts/parse.html.pl
	  - Ship scripts/parse.xhtml.pl
	  - Ship t/Data.pm to read in test data from t/data/
	  - Rewrite t/*.t to use t/Data.pm
	  - Patch Simple.pm to accept xhtml as a parameter to new
	  - Patch Simple.pm to use xhtml in a few of places. XHTML support is not finished!
	  - Patch Simple.pm to use accessors for object attributes as per PBP. Specifically:
	  get/set_*() for current_node, depth, input_dir, node_type, output_dir, root, verbose, xhtml
	  - Hence, rename root() to get_root()
	  - Hence, rename verbose() to get_verbose()
	  - Rename new_node() to create_new_node(), since that makes more sense when using get/set_*()
	  - There are no methods get_result() and set_result(). The reason is efficiency. If we had
	  $self -> set_result($self -> get_result() + '<tag>') it would mean duplicating the result so far
	  each time a few chars were added
	  - Ship various tests, with data, for XHTML
	  - Add depth to the hashref of data for each tag's node in the tree
	  - Put the code in github: git://github.com/ronsavage/html--parser--simple.git
